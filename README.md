# Hello, I'm Crystal 🐸

I'm currently a 4th year Applied & Computational Mathematics major at UCI. I am interested in working and researching in the applications of mathematics in engineering and computer science. Work-Life balance is important to me as I enjoy spending time with my friends and making silly little websites. Check out some of my projects!
